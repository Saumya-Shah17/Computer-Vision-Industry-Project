🔍 Project Overview: Injection moulding is crucial for mass-producing complex plastic parts with precision. Our goal was to develop an affordable, highly accurate solution to count parts on a production line using computer vision and AI. By deploying high-speed cameras and dynamically processing footage using AI algorithms, we achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 98%, significantly reducing the reliance on manual labor.

💡 Key Achievements:

- Achieved near-perfect accuracy in counting parts with computer vision.

- Implemented a contactless and reliable measurement system using AI.

- Developed hardware to support multiple cameras on a single computer system.

- Utilized open-source Python tools for seamless analysis and implementation.
